# 📚 My Flutter References & Demos

Welcome to **my-flutter-refs** — a curated collection of my Flutter learning projects and theoretical references.  
This repository is organized by lessons, where each lesson contains:
- A **Flutter project** (practical coding exercise)
- A **Web reference** (theoretical notes, discussions, or supporting material)

## 📌 Notes

- Each lesson folder has its own `README.md` with details and screenshots.
- Heavy build files are excluded via `.gitignore` for a clean repo.
- This repo is meant as both a **study archive** and a **portfolio showcase**.

Would you like me to also draft a **per-lesson README template** (for inside each `lesson_xx` folder) so you can keep everything consistent across demos?****
